# Halloween-Project  
The project was made using a pumpkin candy bucket, an Arduino uno, the pir sensor and the ISD1820 module.  
When the pir sensor detects something the pumpkin eyes (LEDs) will light up and the ISD1820 will play a spooky sound.  
You can put the candy bucket wherever you like, but the main ideia is to leave it at your door with a lot of candy.
